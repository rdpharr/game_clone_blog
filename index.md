title: Total Battle Clone - Dev Blog
---

## Welcome

I'm building a 3D mobile runner game as a **personal learning project** - recreating Total Battle's mechanics without the dark patterns, microtransactions, or purchasing pressure. This blog documents the journey from planning to Android APK.

**Why?** To learn game development and play the game I want - pure gameplay without ads, timers, or manipulation.

**Tech Stack:** Godot 4 (free), Claude Code (AI assistant), Kenney.nl assets (free)

## What's in it for you
You should be able to use the same method to create a game for yourself. Actually, it shoudl be easier:
1. Go to the github for this project and download the DESIGN.md
2. Make the changes to improve it so that your game is better than mine
3. Setup a Godot MCP from godot-mcp
4. Tell your AI Coding agent (Cursor, Claude, whatever) to build the thing from the design doc

Or just follow along while I try to make this owkr for me
