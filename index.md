# Building a 3D Mobile Runner Game

I'm creating a clone of Total Battle's runner/auto-battle mechanics using **Godot 4** as a solo developer with **Claude Code** as my coding assistant. This is a **personal learning project** - I want to understand how these games work and create a version I can enjoy without dark patterns, pay-to-win mechanics, or purchasing pressure.

## Project Purpose

**This is for learning and personal use only.** I'm not publishing this commercially. The goal is to:
- Understand mobile game mechanics from the inside
- Learn Godot 4's 3D capabilities
- Practice AI-assisted development with Claude Code
- **Play the game I want** - no ads, no microtransactions, no psychological manipulation

Too many mobile games use dark patterns to extract money. I want to experience the core gameplay loop that makes these games fun, without the pressure to spend or the artificial barriers designed to frustrate players into purchasing.

## Project Stats

**Engine:** Godot 4  
**Platform:** Android  
**Budget:** $0 (free assets only)  
**Purpose:** Learning & personal enjoyment

## What I'm Building

A 3D mobile runner combining:
- Auto-advancing lane-based movement
- Auto-shooting mechanics (target barrels and gates)
- Collectible multiplier zones
- Simple auto-battle combat
- Progressive difficulty across 20+ stages

Think Temple Run meets auto-chess, with a medieval fantasy theme - but without the frustration-based monetization.

## The Tech Stack

**Why Godot 4?** 
- 100% free and open source
- Excellent 3D engine for mobile
- GDScript is perfect for AI-assisted development
- One-click Android export
- Zero hidden costs
- Complete control over my own game

**Development Approach:**
- Build-first learning (minimal tutorials)
- Using Claude Code for guidance and code generation
- Free assets from Kenney.nl
- Git for version control
- Obsidian vault for documentation

## Why This Project?

**Learning Goals:**
- Master Godot 4's 3D capabilities
- Understand mobile game optimization
- Learn Android export process
- Practice AI-assisted development with Claude Code
- Reverse-engineer what makes these games engaging

**Personal Goals:**
- Play without artificial timers or energy systems
- No pressure to make purchases
- No ads interrupting gameplay
- Experience the pure game mechanics
- Understand how casual mobile games work behind the scenes

**Design Philosophy:**
> "Build first, learn as you go. You learn better by doing than by watching tutorials."

This approach means diving into actual game development immediately, using Claude Code to help navigate challenges as they arise.

## What to Expect Here

I'll be posting about:
- **Development Progress** - Weekly updates on what's working (and what isn't)
- **Technical Breakdowns** - Deep dives into specific mechanics and implementations
- **Claude Code Workflows** - How I'm using AI assistance effectively
- **Asset Management** - Working with free 3D assets from Kenney.nl
- **Mobile Optimization** - Making it run smoothly on Android
- **Game Design Insights** - What makes these mechanics engaging vs. manipulative
- **Lessons Learned** - Mistakes, discoveries, and insights

## Follow Along

Check the blog posts below for detailed development updates. I'll be documenting the entire journey from zero to APK, including all the stumbles and victories along the way.

This is a learning journey - I'm figuring things out as I go, with Claude Code as my guide.
