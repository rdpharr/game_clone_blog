# Building a 3D Mobile Runner Game

I'm creating a clone of Total Battle's runner/auto-battle mechanics using **Godot 4** as a solo developer with **Claude Code** as my coding assistant. This blog chronicles the journey from concept to Android APK.

**Important Note:** This is a **personal learning project for individual use only**. I'm not creating a commercial product or competing with the original game. This is about learning game development by recreating mechanics I find interesting, without any of the monetization pressure.

## Project Stats

**Engine:** Godot 4  
**Platform:** Android  
**Budget:** $0 (free assets only)  
**Timeline:** 3-5 months (Dec 2025 - April/May 2026)  
**Status:** Pre-Development (Planning Complete)  
**Purpose:** Learning & Personal Use Only

## Why Build This?

**The Real Motivation:**

I enjoy the core gameplay loop of Total Battle's runner mode, but I don't enjoy:
- Constant purchase prompts and paywalls
- Energy systems that limit playtime
- Aggressive monetization dark patterns
- Pay-to-win mechanics
- Daily login pressure and FOMO tactics

**What I want instead:**
- Pure gameplay without interruptions
- Play as much as I want, whenever I want
- No ads, no timers, no artificial restrictions
- Just the fun runner/combat mechanics
- A game I built myself, understanding every system

This project is about **reclaiming the joy of gaming** by building exactly what I want to play, free from all the psychological manipulation common in mobile games.

## What I'm Building

A clean, no-pressure 3D mobile runner combining:
- Auto-advancing lane-based movement
- Auto-shooting mechanics (target barrels and gates)
- Collectible multiplier zones
- Simple auto-battle combat
- Progressive difficulty across 20+ stages

Think Temple Run meets auto-chess, with a medieval fantasy theme — **but completely free of dark patterns**.

## The No-Monetization Guarantee

This game will have:
- ✅ **No in-app purchases** - ever
- ✅ **No ads** - ever
- ✅ **No energy systems** - play unlimited
- ✅ **No daily login rewards** - no FOMO manipulation
- ✅ **No pay-to-win** - skill-based progression only
- ✅ **No artificial timers** - everything is instant
- ✅ **No push notifications** - play on your own terms

Just pure gameplay, the way games should be.

## The Tech Stack

**Why Godot 4?** 
- 100% free and open source
- Excellent 3D engine for mobile
- GDScript is perfect for AI-assisted development
- One-click Android export
- Zero hidden costs
- No revenue sharing or licensing fees

**Development Approach:**
- Build-first learning (minimal tutorials)
- Using Claude Code for guidance and code generation
- Free assets from Kenney.nl
- Git for version control
- Obsidian vault for documentation

## Development Timeline

### Weeks 1-2: Core Prototype
Building the foundation: movement, lane switching, basic combat, and collectibles.

### Weeks 3-4: Advanced Mechanics  
Auto-shooting system, gate mechanics, multiplier zones, particle effects.

### Weeks 5-8: Content & Polish
Multiple unit types, enemy variety, visual effects, sound design.

### Weeks 9-12: Stage Creation
Creating 20+ unique stages with progressive difficulty.

### Weeks 13-16: Optimization
Android performance tuning, touch controls, screen adaptation.

### Weeks 17-20: Final Polish
Testing, refinement, and APK preparation.

## Why This Project?

**Learning Goals:**
- Master Godot 4's 3D capabilities
- Understand mobile game optimization
- Learn Android export process
- Practice AI-assisted development with Claude Code
- **Build something I actually want to use**

**Design Philosophy:**
> "Build first, learn as you go. You learn better by doing than by watching tutorials."

This approach means diving into actual game development immediately, using Claude Code to help navigate challenges as they arise.

**Personal Philosophy:**
> "Games should be fun, not manipulative. I'm building what I wish existed: the core gameplay I enjoy without any of the exploitative monetization."

## What to Expect Here

I'll be posting about:
- **Development Progress** - Weekly updates on what's working (and what isn't)
- **Technical Breakdowns** - Deep dives into specific mechanics and implementations
- **Claude Code Workflows** - How I'm using AI assistance effectively
- **Asset Management** - Working with free 3D assets from Kenney.nl
- **Mobile Optimization** - Making it run smoothly on Android
- **Design Decisions** - Why I'm building it this way, without dark patterns
- **Lessons Learned** - Mistakes, discoveries, and insights

## The Build Plan

I'm following a structured 20-week development plan broken into daily tasks. Week 1 focuses on:
- Day 1-2: Project setup and environment
- Day 3-4: Basic 3D movement and lane switching
- Day 5: Collision detection
- Day 6: Collectibles and UI
- Day 7: Testing and refinement

Each week builds on the previous, gradually adding complexity.

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Project feasibility assessment
- Technology stack selection (Godot 4)
- 20-week development plan
- Stage design system
- Asset management strategy

📅 **Next Steps:**
1. Download Godot 4
2. Set up development environment
3. Download Kenney 3D asset packs
4. Begin Week 1, Day 1: Project Setup

## Legal & Ethical Notes

**This is a learning project for personal use:**
- Not for commercial release or distribution
- Using original game mechanics as learning reference only
- All assets are free/open source (Kenney.nl)
- Code is original, written with Claude Code assistance
- Built to understand game development, not to compete with or replace the original

I respect the original developers' work. This project is about learning from their design and building my own implementation to understand how it works — and to create a version I can enjoy without the monetization pressure.

## Follow Along

Check the blog posts below for detailed development updates. I'll be documenting the entire journey from zero to APK, including all the stumbles and victories along the way.

If you're also frustrated with mobile game monetization and want to learn how to build the games you wish existed, this blog is for you.
