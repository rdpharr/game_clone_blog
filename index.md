title: Total Battle Clone - Dev Blog
---

## Welcome

I'm building a 3D mobile runner game as a **personal learning project** - recreating Total Battle's mechanics without the dark patterns, microtransactions, or purchasing pressure. This blog documents the journey from planning to Android APK.

**Why?** To learn game development and play the game I want - pure gameplay without ads, timers, or manipulation.

**Tech Stack:** Godot 4 (free), Claude Code (AI assistant), Kenney.nl assets (free)
