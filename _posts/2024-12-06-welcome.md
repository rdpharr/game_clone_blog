Welcome to my game clone development blog!

## Project Overview

This blog will chronicle my journey in creating a game clone from scratch. I'll be sharing:

- **Design Philosophy**: Why I chose this game and what I hope to learn
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Architecture decisions, algorithms, and implementations
- **Progress Updates**: Regular updates on what's working (and what isn't)
- **Challenges & Solutions**: Problems I encounter and how I solve them

## What to Expect

I'll be posting regularly about my progress, with a mix of:
- Code snippets and explanations
- Screenshots and demos
- Retrospectives on what I've learned

Stay tuned for more updates as the project evolves!
